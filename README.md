# The Hartree-Fock Method
## For the Helium Atom

## Intro
Quantum-Mechanical systems are naturally complicated. For systems bigger than hydrogen, the particle-particle dependence of the potential energies makes the Schrodinger equation unsolvable. The Hartree-Fock approximation neglects some of the inter-particle dependence, which simplfies the equation. When we applied the Hartree-Fock approx to Helium, we obtained a solvable system. We solved the eigenvalue problem corresponding to the ground state for helium.

## Method
Started with the Schrodinger Equation for Helium, which is a convenient relationship between a system's wavefunction and energy.

Guess a form for the wavefunction. We used a 4-element parameterization from Thjissel

Apply the self-consistent field method.

## Results
Our calculated values were very good approximations.

Could be very useful for other systems, such as ___
