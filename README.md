# The Hartree-Fock Method
## For the Helium Atom

## Background
Quantum-Mechanical systems are naturally complicated. For systems bigger than hydrogen, the particle-particle dependence of the potential energies makes the Schrodinger equation unsolvable. The Hartree-Fock approximation neglects some of the inter-particle dependence, which simplfies the equation. When we applied the Hartree-Fock approx to Helium, we obtained a solvable system. We solved the eigenvalue problem corresponding to the ground state for helium.

## Using the script
The script will output successive approximations for the ground state energy until two successive results are within \epsilon of each other. \Epsilon is currently set at 10^-6. \cos $\cos$

This project was done as part of an independent study research class at Lee University. Much help was received from mentor Dr. David Pigg and student collaborator Rebekah Petrosky. Parameterization for wavefunction was taken from Jos Thijssen's book *Computational Physics.*
